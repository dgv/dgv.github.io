title: web3 is here
lead: what remains after all hype.
---
## tl;dr

I'm aware of current criticism, I'm follower of [web3 is going just great](https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/) from [Molly White](https://mastodon.social/@molly0xfff@hachyderm.io) but also a [techno-optimist](https://andrewkelley.me/post/the-techno-optimist-manifesto.html) _Ã  la Thoreau_ (not [Andressen's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno-Optimist_Manifesto)),
so even working close to blockchains and using bitcoin since 2014 I always been skeptical until last years events. The idea here is not to convince or promote anything, just summarize some definitions and references about how things are going at this point.

## btw, what is web3?

The term "web3" was coined in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder [Gavin Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Wood), is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web which incorporates concepts such as **decentralization**, **blockchain** technologies, and **token-based** economics.

So, it's over right? I don't think so... With all attention going to A.I stuff things start to get interesting for me.

## web3 is here to stay

We can't ignore some things, the bitcoin seminal paper above is from 2009, now the reality is:

- Bitcoin marketcap alone is more than [U$2 trilions](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)
- BlackRock _megazord_ [holds 2.38%](https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-tops-500k-btc-holdings-48b) of all Bitcoin
- [BITCOIN Act of 2024](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4912) is a bill for acquisition and storage of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin by the U.S. government
- Since 2018 central banks started to use blockchain for implementing [digital currencies](https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d174.pdf) (aka CBDC, like [here](https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/financialstability/drex_en))
- All major cloud providers like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/web3/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/web3), [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/web3/) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/web3) has solutions for web3 like managed blockchains

So, ponzi scheme or not, meme-shit-coin or not, it's real and just a part of thing... Here in Brazil for some time many financial institutions started to offer crypto wallets supporting Bitcoin and Etherium and services integrated on their apps, more than [4 million](https://www.fintechnexus.com/brazils-fintechs-banks-dive-into-crypto-as-demand-heats-up/) people started to use it.

## web3>DeFI

DeFI or _decentralized finance_ is the most famous or common use case on web3 followed by NFTs, despite usage of blockchains for [supply chains](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain-supply-chain) we have bunch of other applications.
Forget about [ICO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering)s scams, NFTs and expensive [ens.domains](https://ens.domains) let's see some useful dApps examples:

- [Daimo](https://daimo.com/): payments like Paypal
- [Fileverse](https://fileverse.io): file sharing like Dropbox
- [Huddle01](https://huddle01.com/): RTC platform like Zoom
- [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/): communitties like Reddit/X
- [Soundxyz](https://www.sound.xyz/): audio streaming like Spotify
- [Status](https://status.im/): communication/wallet app like Wechat

We also have another things like [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://attest.org/) or the usage of [zero-knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) protocols [to prove identity](https://github.com/anon-aadhaar) or [machine learning models](https://www.accountablemagic.com/).
We also have govs using blockchains...
- [KSI blockchain in Estonia](https://e-estonia.com/wp-content/uploads/faq_ksi_blockchain.pdf)
- [Blockchain in the UAE government](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/digital-uae/digital-technology/blockchain-in-the-uae-government)
- India [attempts](https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/29/india_txt_spam_crackdown/) to use blockchain and AI to stop spammers they establish whole [governance plan](https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2020-01/Blockchain_The_India_Strategy_Part_I.pdf) to use blockchain with couple use cases
- [Brazil government begins to use blockchain to issue national IDs](https://www-gov-br.translate.goog/gestao/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/2023/setembro/governo-comeca-a-utilizar-o-blockchain-na-emissao-da-carteira-de-identidade-nacional?_x_tr_sl=pt&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=pt-BR&_x_tr_pto=wapp)

## civil rights

I follow Molly and changed my mind after some events, one of most interesting stories is about [Privacy, human rights, and Tornado Cash](https://www.citationneeded.news/tornado-cash/), great oportunity to understand her points, another interesting [episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_convoy_protest) occurred years earlier in Canada during prostests against COVID-19 vaccination and related restrictions in 2022, btw I personally took my astrazeneca/pfizer shots, the point here is not about vaccination but disproportional acts from state, we saw how censorship and unapropriate [debanking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-banking) works on democracies, or when the Canadian prime minister [imposed martial law](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/trudeau-mulls-invoking-emergency-powers-quell-protests-82882930) on the protestors. I'm tired to see here in Brazil justice blocking apps like [Telegram](https://www.barrons.com/news/brazil-court-suspends-telegram-messaging-app-in-neo-nazi-probe-dea4c8cf), [WhatsApp](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/19/whatsapp-blocked-in-brazil-again), [X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_of_Twitter_in_Brazil), and debanking [people](https://blog-areabitcoin-com-br.translate.goog/daniel-fraga/?_x_tr_sl=pt&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=pt-BR&_x_tr_pto=wapp). The necessity of crypto in western democracies is clear.

_But crypto are helping mafias and banned states_, well, [drug money saved banks in global crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2009/dec/13/drug-money-banks-saved-un-cfief-claims), now even states and their central banks are using blockchain technology, ready for the perfect state distopy of surveillance and censorship. Money is a tool, and a cryptocurrency is just one part or application of web3 ecosystem.

## how decentralized and efficient it is?

Moxie (creator of Signal messenger) [posted](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html) his first web3 impressions in 2022 during NFT hype and criticizes the centralization, but as Vitalik [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ryk3it/comment/hrrz15r/) he was right in many things but _missed where the blockchain ecosystem is going_...

[![crypto_pwr](/assets/files/crypto_pwr.png)](https://x.com/SkylineReport/status/1805054873861292526)

Etherium is using [proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) since 2022 [dropping power consumption in 99,84%](https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption) and improving his [decentralization](https://medium.com/foundry-digital/the-evolution-of-ethereum-decentralization-cf55ccfcee4f), now all crypto power consumption became a joke with Microsoft [reopening a nuclear powerplant](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25v2d7zexo) for _AI_ ([_AI vs Bitcoin mining: Which consumes more energy?_](https://wired.me/science/energy/ai-vs-bitcoin-mining-energy/)).

I know, the things still dirty for Bitcoin/Proof-of-work mining, but the point isn't only about of efficiency or how fast a transaction could be done, but also the values of decentralized systems brings, like resilience over censorship attacks or single points of failure, as pointed on the link above, it will never beat the efficience of centralized solutions (Etherium PoS vs Mastercard), but despite _AI_ thing were most of LLMs models are closed and hungry for the latest available GPUs, on web3 the barriers are lower, the technology is open and we can see even african countries using it to [mitigate inflation and trading](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/africa-cryptocurrency-adoption/).

## conclusion

In life we basically manage tradeoffs, I cited Moxie earlier, I respect him and love the simplicity and values of Signal, but there is so many [contradictions](https://dessalines.github.io/essays/why_not_signal.html) and even running
it as 501c3 nonprofit organization they [tried to bring MobileCoin](https://cointelegraph.com/news/signal-under-fire-over-mobilecoin-partnership)...

I know, none of dApps or even federated alternatives (using ActivityPub for example)
have the adoption of closed ones, the most interesting thing for me are the enabler technologies of web3, was very interesting the introduction of
[lightning network](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf) on Bitcoin and the [transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13655) of Etherium to proof-of-stake, or explore foundation parts like [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) on [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System) or for another applications like IoT.

In the end of day even if you are not using crypto is important to have compeling alternatives not only for state fiat money,
but also for apps we are obliged to use everyday (self-hosted or/and web3 options), integrated funding or payment models, ultimaly we are advancing on distributed systems technology, cryptography, censorship resistency, and most of things are open and free.
