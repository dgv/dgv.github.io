— Richard Feynman

I’m a [techno-optimist](https://andrewkelley.me/post/the-techno-optimist-manifesto.html) with almost two decades of experience in crafting software. My passion lies in deep work, leading small teams, and solving complex and challenging problems. Currently running some projects and consulting, open for new opportunities. Outside of computery things I enjoy walking, hiking, reading, and piano.
