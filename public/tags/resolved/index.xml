      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chromecast is one of those devices I just generally use a lot. They are small&#xA;practical and enables me to stream video or music to my TV from multiple&#xA;devices. But it also requires you to have a supported browser or video player.&#xA;This is obviously a bit boring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There has been multiple command line chromecast streamers through the years. But&#xA;their ffmpeg usage has been shoddy at best with no hardware decoding support and&#xA;usually quite bad implementations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
