## values

don't be clever<br>
code is a liability<br>
ask, learn, and teach<br>
design and architecture matter<br>
first make it correct then make it fast<br>
only make it fast if you know it matters<br>
it's not done until customers are getting value<br>
it's not done until there's nothing left to take away<br>
don't automate something you haven't done manually<br>
quick incremental progress is better than the alternative<br>
code is shared by the team. there is no such thing as my code<br>
it's easier to change a dry-erase board than a production system<br>
code is written to be understood by humans first, computers second<br>
