<p>This enables users to build packages and compare them with the ones distributed

source during the build, which in turns enhances the overall supply chain security.
We are one of the first binary distributions that has achieved this, and can
provide tooling down to users.</p>
<p>That was the TL;DR! The rest of the blog post will explain the reproducible
builds efforts, and the technical work that has gone into achieving this.</p>
<h3 id="reproducible-builds">Reproducible Builds</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">reproducible builds</a> effort was started
by Debian in 2013 and currently encompasses <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/who/">several
projects</a> across the spectrum, from
coreboot, Bitcoin, NixOS and F-Droid to mention a few.</p>
<p>The goal of the effort is to figure out what makes software projects
undeterministic, and come up with standards to solve these issues.</p>
<p>Two of these standards are
<a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/"><code>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</code></a>
to ensure timestamps can be overridden during the build, and
<a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/build-path-prefix-map/"><code>BUILD_PATH_PREFIX_MAP</code></a>
to ensure we can consistently trim build paths across toolchains.
<code>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</code> has been integrated into
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Environment-Variables.html">gcc</a> and the
toolchain for several projects.  <code>BUILD_PATH_PREFIX_MAP</code> however has not seen a
lot of adoption yet.</p>
<p>Another project they work on is a Continuous Integration (CI) framework to test
reproducible packages. The Debian one is probably more interesting to
<a href="https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/reproducible.html">browse</a>, but
Arch Linux has a <a href="https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/archlinux/archlinux.html">CI
environment</a> for
the past two years which has been consistently rebuilding packages.</p>
<p>However, the CI does not address the real issue. It is a very nice tool for
debugging and uncovering issues that cause undeterministic builds. As Holger
explained on the debian-devel mailing list <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2019/03/msg00017.html">earlier this
year</a>, &ldquo;these tests
are done without looking at the actual .deb files distributed from
ftp.debian.org (and we always knew that and pointed it out: &ldquo;93% reproducible
<em>in our current test framework</em>&rdquo;)&rdquo;. We are essentially building the same set of
files twice in different environments.</p>
<p>Ensuring software projects can be deterministically built is all fine and dandy,
but we grant users the ability to verify the work package maintainers are doing.</p>
<h3 id="reproducing-packages">Reproducing packages</h3>
<p>There are a few components needed to ensure packages can be rebuilt. We need to
record the environment of the package build. This needs to be build paths,
timestamps, all dependencies installed on the system and a bunch of other
information. This is standardized in different formats <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/recording/">across
projects</a>, but the format used
for pacman can be found in <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/BUILDINFO.5.html"><code>BUILDINFO(5)</code></a>.</p>
<p>One can explore a BUILDINFO file from any package by extracting the top-level
file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="line"><span class="cl">bsdtar -xOf archlinux-keyring-20191018-1-any.pkg.tar.xz .BUILDINFO
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Pacman also keeps tracks of some metadata inside <code>.PKGINFO</code>. On the surface this
seems trivial, record some information and put it into a file. Like &ldquo;How much
space does this package take?&rdquo;. But counting file sizes is <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/61717">a
problem</a>.
<a href="https://git.archlinux.org/pacman.git/commit/?id=b264fb9e9ddcc31dc8782390309421965e507383">Counting</a>
<a href="https://git.archlinux.org/pacman.git/commit/?id=7f258619c6c0e9f441aacbabfc1a2f5980c5cb9b">file</a>
<a href="https://git.archlinux.org/pacman.git/commit/?id=3f1ea8b62f46a915c94a5b46e21ad39ea2628f65">sizes</a>
is
<a href="https://git.archlinux.org/pacman.git/commit/?id=241d6b884a3a6c883b6c61a3b175d17e7d317fc5">hard</a>.
Like,
<a href="https://git.archlinux.org/pacman.git/commit/?id=f26cb61cb6a16c8ce85f33e6090763aced0118c3">very</a>
<a href="https://git.archlinux.org/pacman.git/commit/?id=0272fca993718460bf7ecb7fdc3ca7dad1c7e6cd">hard</a>.
Someone even wanted <code>--skipbtrfshack</code> in
<a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/32228">makepkg</a> at some point. We have also had
some problems <a href="https://git.archlinux.org/pacman.git/commit/?id=b5191ea140386dd9b73e4509ffa9a6d347c1b5fa">sorting
files</a>,
and bsdtar <code>fflags</code> embedding information <a href="https://git.archlinux.org/pacman.git/commit/?id=a897599fa54813ea2a225271eacd9fb6e1a6762e">unique to the
system</a>.</p>
<p>But these quirks should have been solved, and we haven&rsquo;t found any other issues,
yet. This means we got packages which can be consistently created, and we have
recorded the build information. Now we need to recreate the build environment.</p>
<p>Arch Linux is a rolling release distribution. We probably build and release
between 20 and 100 packages every day. With no set release schedule, packages
can get rotated in, and out, of a repository on the same day. When recoding the
installed packages in the <code>BUILDINFO</code> files, this could in theory change several
times a day. How do we reproduce a package released 2 weeks ago?</p>
<p>The main solution to this is to record all released packages, and that is what
we do on <a href="https://archive.archlinux.org">https://archive.archlinux.org</a>. A lot of the older packages are uploaded
to
<a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Arch+Linux%22">archive.org</a>
and linked from the archive. This enables us to rebuild packages back in time,
as long as the installed pacman was <code>&gt;=5.2</code>.</p>
<p>Recreating the build environment for the package is the next mission. Arguably
this step came before other parts of this blog post, but technically this
probably makes sense ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯.</p>
<p>We need to create a chroot and apply the needed environment changes. In devtools
we utilize <code>systemd-nspawn</code> to create these chroot containers, and this in turn
was the starting point for
<a href="https://github.com/archlinux/archlinux-repro">archlinux-repro</a>. It provides two
tools, <code>repro</code> which takes a package file and attempts to reproduce the package
given the package file, and <code>buildinfo</code> which is a helper tool to read the
<code>BUILDINFO</code> file and download packages from the archive.</p>
<p>The goal of <code>archlinux-repro</code> is to be distribution agnostic. You should be able
to reproduce Arch packages on any distribution and verify they are the same as
the distributed package. There is still some work left on this as we utilize
<code>systemd-nspawn</code> for chrooting, and we also need to inititalize a keyring. This
means you can&rsquo;t rebuild Arch packages on your preferred distribution just yet.
We are also working on <a href="https://github.com/eli-schwartz/devtools/blob/reproducible/makerepropkg.in"><code>devtools</code>
additions</a>
which enables us to provide tooling more tightly integrated into our existing
tools.</p>
<p>The input of <code>repro</code> is a package, however this alone is not enough to rebuild a
package. We need the <code>PKGBUILD</code> file. Internally all Arch packages are stored in
an SVN repository. This is a bit tedious to work with, but we provide a tool
called <code>asp</code> which pulls a given package down from a Git mirror of the SVN
repository.</p>
<p>And for the fun of it, the first package we have to try to reproduce is
obviously pacman:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ repro pacman-5.2.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz

</code></pre><p>If the result would have wound up as unreproducible, the reproducible builds
project has created &ldquo;diffoscope&rdquo; a tool to compare many different types of files
and discover the differences between them. It is used in the CI environment, so
we can take a look at the <a href="https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/archlinux/core/glib2/glib2-2.62.2-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz.html">diffoscope output from
glib2</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-future">The future?</h3>
<p>The end goal should be to make any artifacts produced by Arch Linux
reproducible. We currently have <a href="https://github.com/archlinux/mkinitcpio/pull/1">reproducible initramfs in
mkinitcpio</a>, and having this
with the archiso releases would be beneficial as well. Having independent
rebuilders verifying the distributed packages as they are published is also
something we really want to accomplish. However we always need more hands to
help!</p>
